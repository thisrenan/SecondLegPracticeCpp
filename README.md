# SecondLegPracticeCpp

This list of exercises is related to C++ programming studies and corresponds to the second part of the study.
The list involves variable manipulation and programming logic, repetition loops and switch statements.

# Welcome to the First C++ Practice

Lets practice what we have been studying.

1. Chico is 1.50 meters tall and grows 2 centimeters per year, while Zé is 1.10 meters tall and grows 3 centimeters per year. Create an algorithm that calculates and prints how many years it will take for Zé to be taller than Chico.

2. Create an algorithm that reads an undetermined set of values ​​and reports, at the end, the highest and lowest values ​​read. The algorithm should end if the user enters a negative value or the value 0.

3. Create an algorithm that requests a value from the user and generates the multiplication table for that value. For example, if the user enters the value 2, the multiplication table for the number 2 should be generated, ranging from 0 to 10.

4. Create a program that requests an undetermined number of whole numbers from the user. The program should calculate and write the arithmetic mean of only even numbers. Data entry should end when the number 0 (ZERO) is entered.

5. Write a program that prompts the user for a positive real number. Check if the number is really positive, and if not, prompt the user to enter it again (this process can be repeated countless times and is called consistency, as it ensures that the number will be valid after data entry). Outputs:
• Prompt to user = “Enter a positive real number”; • Valid number case = “The number entered is valid";
• Invalid number case = “Invalid number, try again”

6. Write a program for a simple calculator that asks the user for two operands as input, selects one of the options from the list (1- sum, 2- product, 3- division, 4- power) and displays the result. The algorithm should run repeatedly until both operands are equal to zero.

7. Write an algorithm that asks for an integer value and reports, at the end, the factorial of this value.
Note: for example, the factorial of 5 is 120, since 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.

8. Write an algorithm that generates the Fibonacci series, up to the term n entered by the user. For example, if the user enters the value 6, 8 should be displayed on the screen.
Note: Fibonacci series: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

9. Write a program that asks for the ages of 10 people and displays the number of people who are 18 or older.

10. Write a program that checks whether a number entered by the user is a prime number, that is, a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.
Outputs:
• Request to the user = “Enter an integer:” If it is prime = “The number is prime”;
• If it is not prime = “The number is not prime”.
